        <h3>Why SevaKosh?</h3>
        <p >
          At SevaKosh, we believe that giving should be meaningful, transparent, and community-driven. Unlike
          traditional donation platforms, SevaKosh empowers society members to directly choose and support verified
          causes, ensuring every rupee makes a real difference. We operate with complete transparency—sharing bills,
          reports, and updates with every donor. Our model prioritizes accountability by involving society
          representatives in every stage of the donation process. With a strong focus on impact and trust, SevaKosh is
          not just a platform—it's a movement to make charitable giving more honest, efficient, and impactful for
          everyone involved.
