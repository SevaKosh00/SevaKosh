      <h2>The Problem with Traditional Donations</h2>
      <p>Charity has always been a cornerstone of a compassionate society, yet the process of donating remains riddled with inefficiencies and uncertainty. Many individuals and businesses have the desire to give back, but the lack of transparency often holds them back. In most cases, donors have no clear insight into where their money is going, how it is being utilized, or whether it is even reaching those in need. Without proper verification, funds can be misused, lost in administrative gaps, or distributed without ensuring they make the maximum possible impact. This lack of structure and accountability discourages many from contributing, leaving billions in potential donations untapped. SevaKosh was created to address these challenges and revolutionize the way philanthropy works.</p>
